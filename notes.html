<h1>URL stands for *Uniform Resource Locator*.</h1>
<p> It contains serveral different parts, including:
<ul>
<l1> the **protocol**: e.g. http, https, ftp
<l2> the **host**: e.g. www.facebook.com, www.bbc.co.uk
<l3> the **path**: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95
</ul>
<h2> DNS</h2>
<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. 123-reg, GoDaddy). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.
Server-side vs. Client-side technologies</p>

<p> Client-side</p>

<h3>Client-side technologies run in your web browser (e.g Firefox, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer). The three main client-side technologies are:
<ol>
<li> HTML
<li> CSS
<li> Javascript
</ol>
<p> Server-side</p>

<h4>Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here.</h4>
